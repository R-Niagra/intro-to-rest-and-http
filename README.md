# Server-Side Concepts and REST

This repository is meant for individuals who have a basic understanding of a
programming language (e.g. Python, JavaScript, Java) and have had some exposure
to the concepts of REST and/or HTTP but don't feel confident explaining them.

It serves two purposes.

First, it serves the purpose of introducing Server-Side Concepts and REST.
Below you will find a link to a series of Medium articles where I discuss concepts that
are important to developing an understanding of REST.

[Demystifying REST — Part 1: What Is It?](https://medium.com/@kevinarthur/demystifying-rest-part-1-what-is-it-d349b441586b?source=friends_link&sk=e107aa2c55884e0433da515912146aa1)

[Demystifying REST — Part 2: How Does It Work?](https://medium.com/@kevinarthur/demystifying-rest-part-2-how-does-it-work-82dd6411b5d9?source=friends_link&sk=90c69401cfa535975f569dc729b786c0)

[Demystifying REST — Part 3: A Demo](https://medium.com/@kevinarthur/demystifying-rest-part-3-a-demo-857a2f6a9700?source=friends_link&sk=74d9f3a58bddcd93c61fcf709cdfcfd0)

Second, it serves as a way of using a programming language to practice these concepts.
Included in this repository is a directory titled `node-rest-server` that specifies a
challenge and resources available to you to help you complete the challenge. You are to
implement a REST server using Node.js. You will incrementally build the REST server using
the provided tests to guide you.

I want to stress that although we are using Node.js to illustrate the concepts explored in
the article, these concepts are not tied to any one specific programming language. Further
iterations of this project will allow knowledge-seekers to implement a REST server in other
languages e.g. Python, Java, Go, etc.

Workflow:

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Add a remote so you can pull down any updates to the repo.
  - HTTPS: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/hyperbolic-time-chamber/intro-to-rest-and-http.git`
  - SSH: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:hyperbolic-time-chamber/intro-to-rest-and-http.git`
- Read through the content on Medium once (it's okay if it doesn't all make sense).
- Work on the challenge located in the `node-rest-server` directory.
- Read through the article a second time and look to clarify any misunderstandings.
